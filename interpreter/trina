Happy Birthday Nikita!!! im so glad we got to know each other better this year and i wouldnt wanna share an apartment with anyone else (i mean who else could convince me to eat all my vegetables). i love that were always yelling at each other about things we both do like having a bad sleep schedule and doing cs. and i love all of the memes that we tag each other in (except that pipelined processor one because iT was NoT funNY) and just generally letting everyone find out how random/weird/what a mess we are 24/7. hopefully we have fewer existential crises next year but im glad to know we can at least have each other s back through them and not leave at 3am. and im happy that theres at least one other person in og single squad w me (unless &&&& you can fill in the blank here ;)))). anyways happy birthdayyyyy and im so excited to see you in like < 12 hours. - trina
