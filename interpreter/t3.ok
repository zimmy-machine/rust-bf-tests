i’m so glad we got to know each other better this year and i wouldn’t wanna share an apartment with anyone else (i mean who else could convince me to eat all my vegetables). i love that we’re always yelling at each other about things we both do like having a bad sleep schedule and doing cs. and i love all of the memes that we tag each other in (except that pipelined processor one because iT was NoT funNY) and just generally letting everyone find out how random/weird/what a mess we are 24/7. hopefully we have fewer existential crises next year but i’m glad to know we can at least have each other ’s back through them and not leave at 3am. and i’m happy that there’s at least one other person in og single squad w me (unless ………… you can fill in the blank here ;)))). anyways happy birthdayyyyy and i’m so excited to see you in like < 12 hours. - trina
