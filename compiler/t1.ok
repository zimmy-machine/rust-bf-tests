HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE MOST ICONIC SYSTEMS BRO AND MOM OF THE APARTMENT!!! Thank you for yelling at me to watch OS lectures with you, reminding me to use the "correct" *rolls eyes* cooking tools in the kitchen, putting up with me every time I tell you to be careful while driving, preventing me from dying of boredom in calc last year, gracing us with your artistic and leet hacking talent, being an integral part of HEN, and inspiring me to have an AMAZING sleep schedule like yours (but no thanks to always beating us at Uno and posting pictures of us without C O N S E N T). You're an awesome friend who's always there for us (when ur not busy grading lmao) and down to have a good time. Can't wait to come back to the apartment so we can see each other again! Hope you have a great day filled with fun and not reading papers!!! Love you and happy birthday again:)) - Erika
