HI HI HI NIKITA
I hope you are having a wonderful day. (Though, if you are reading this, you must have been coding, and every day spent coding is a wonderful day am I right! xD)
I am quite glad you are in my life. You are so good at whatever you put your mind to - whether that be TAing, making coding memes, or jumping out of planes. I am very proud of you. Here's to many more adventures.
Happy Holidays,
Happy New Year,
Happy Birthday,
Reed
